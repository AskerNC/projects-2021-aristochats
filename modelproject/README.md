# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Competing in different settings** and is about 2 firms who compete in the same duopolistic market. We will look at three possible competition forms: **Cournot**, **Stackelberg** and **Bertrand**
.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject_done4.0.ipynb](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/projects-2021-aristochats/blob/673ab24e2ceb63169d5e5f45e5583665598b69e6/modelproject/modelproject_done4.0.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
