    "In this paper we examine two firms who have the possibility of competing in Bertrand, Stackelberg and Cournot. We use the same parameter values for all competition types, and find that the firms benefit the most from competing in a Cournot setting as this yields the highest total profits of 22,222. This is intuitive, as in contrast to Bertrand, the firms will undercut each other until their price is equal to their marginal costs to obtain efficiency. Therefore, this setting yields a price as in perfect competition, whereas Cournot yields an oligopoly equilibrium. \n",
    "\n",
    "As Cournot yields the best outcome in terms of profits for two firms, we extend this setting for $n$ firms. We find that for $n\\rightarrow\\infty$, the average profit for a firm decreases because competing in quantities becomes more intense as the competition setting moves from oligopoly to infinitely many firms competing in quantities."
